 This exec implements the UNIX "which" functionality for z/OS as a
 System REXX procedure.  If you add it to the SYS1.SAXREXEC on your system,
 you can invoke it thus:

 F AXR,WHICH procname [procnn]

 Or, assuming "@" is defined as the CPF in AXR00 in SYS1.PARMLIB

 @WHICH procname [procnn]

 For example, on my system:

 @WHICH TYRONE
 TYRONE not found in PROCLIB concatenation PROC00
 @WHICH TYRONE PROC01
 TYRONE not found in PROCLIB concatenation PROC01
 @WHICH LISTMEM PROC01
 ADCDMST.EXEC(LISTMEM)
 @WHICH HLASMC
 HLA.SASMSAM1(HLASMC)
