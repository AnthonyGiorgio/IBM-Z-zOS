** Title: I and ISU                                                  **
**        Invoke ISPF from TSO, ISPF, or OMVS optionally with euid=0 **
**                                                                   **
** Notes: Install this where REXX execs can be found as I and ISU.   **
**        Either copy it twice or make a member alias.               **
**                                                                   **
** Usage: Enter   i  to invoke/reinvoke ISPF.  An ISPF option can be **
**        entered following i (e.g., i 3.4).  From OMVS, enter i on  **
**        the command line and use PF6 to run the command.           **
**                                                                   **
**        isu is the same as i however an attempt will be made to set**
**        your effective uid to 0.  On exit it will attempt to reset **
**        your effective uid to your real uid.                       **
**                                                                   **
